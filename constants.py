Depending on the level of shaking, it causes different amounts of blueberries to fall onto the conveyor belts. Some of these berries are green and unripened, and do not ripen after harvesting. Furthermore, the machines have to be checked and adjusted manually, and unripe berries have to be counted manually. This leads to food and time wastage. The objective of the project is to reduce food waste by lowering the amount of harvested unripe berries. This will be achieved through computer vision software deployed on a Raspberry Pi connected to a camera, which will send data to Firebase to store the data. The data is then displayed on a web page built using ReactJS.",

The web interface allows the user to modify the properties file for deployment, to deploy additional tiles, to run the benchmark and to view the results in a table view based on the storage in local folders and multiple folders, making it easier to compare and analyze results.",

We took the initiative to reorganize and narrow the scope of GDELT 2.0 because the GDELT organization offers a rich source of data on the global media landscape. However, GDELT relies on query-based access using SQL code query the millions of events and event mentions which is unapproachable for many potential users. We have designed a data query and visualization interface that makes your investigation much more intuitive.",
